Introduction
============

Thank you for purchasing the Platypus Lutra 1.x Autonomous Airboat. The Lutra 1.x series boats are low cost autonomous airboats designed for environmental data collection, flood response and related applications. 

The Platypus Lutra 1.x is equipped with a smartphone, which acts as the computing platform for the system and provides the inertial sensors for navigation. The camera in the smartphone provides a stream of images that can be remotely viewed on the operator interface. For advance computing applications, the robot can be upgraded by switching to a more powerful smartphone. The robot can communicate with the computer running the operator interface either via a local wireless network or using 3G cellular network (Cellular card not included). 

The robot is compatible with most commercial environmental sensors. Sensors that are currently supported include Dissolved Oxygen, pH, Temperature, Specific Conductivity, ORP, Depth, Forward and downward high definition cameras. To equip your robot with any of these sensors, please contact customer support (support@senseplatypus.com) to get a quote. The robot itself can also be customized according to the user specific requirements.

Safety and Cautions
-------------------

The propeller of the Lutra 1.x series boats are encased in a protective mesh covered shroud to avoid accidents. The mesh SHOULD NOT BE REMOVED at any point of time while the boat is in operation or when the battery is plugged in. During operation, the propeller on the Lutra 1.x series robots rotate at more than 4000 rpm, hence contact with the propeller can cause serious injury.

In order to build the robot as light as possible, the propulsion assembly on the Platypus Lutra 1.x series is made from 80% impact reinforced Acrylic. Acrylics in general are brittle plastics but the impact reinforcement doubles the strength. Nevertheless the boat should be handled with extreme care while transportation and in use.

The Platypus Lutra 1.x series robots are equipped with an 8000 mAh Lithium Polymer (LiPo) battery. Extreme caution must be taken while handing the LiPo battery as accidental physical damage cased by dropping the battery or denting it might cause the battery to catch fire. Do not leave the battery unattended while charging. Please refer to general safety tips for handing LiPo batteries in the following link: www.maxamps.com/lipo-care.php
